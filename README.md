 What's up I am a Freshman at Washington State University studying Computer Science! (GO COUGS!!)    
 🏃🏻‍♂️ Interesting fact, I am a pole vaulter for WSU's Track & Field team
 🌲 Big outdoor guy, I ski, mountain bike, hike, and more
 Still a newbie in the CS world but I am trying to learn more and more.
